Waits for a paired Bluetooth device to connects and attempts to connect to a A2DP Audio source.
It also accepts incoming A2DP connections.

On startup, connects to the last connected A2DP device.

When a Bluetooth A2DP sink is connected, it runs Pulseaudio command line utilities to connect
the Bluetooth source via a loopback-module to the first detected sink. On disconnect the
loopmack-module is removed.

Bluetooth PIN and authorization has (yet) to be managed externally by means of 
bluetooth-agent or the like
